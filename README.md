# Belly Button Challenge

For this challenge I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The interactive dashboard was built in the following manner:

- Used the JavaScript library, D3, to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json`.

- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the individual selected from the dropdown menu.

- Created a bubble chart that displays each bacteria sample.
